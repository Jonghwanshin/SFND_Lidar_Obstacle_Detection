# Lidar Obstacle Detection

## Summary

This projects segments ground plane and detects objects from point cloud
* Read real lidar data from `sensors/data`
* Segment the ground plant with 3D RANSAC
* Build KD-Tree of the remaining points and detect objects with euclidean clustering

## Installation

### Linux Ubuntu 16

Install PCL, C++

The link here is very helpful, 
https://larrylisky.com/2014/03/03/installing-pcl-on-ubuntu/

A few updates to the instructions above were needed.

* libvtk needed to be updated to libvtk6-dev instead of (libvtk5-dev). The linker was having trouble locating libvtk5-dev while building, but this might not be a problem for everyone.

* BUILD_visualization needed to be manually turned on, this link shows you how to do that,
http://www.pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/building_pcl.php

**Sensor Fusion** by combing lidar's high resolution imaging with radar's ability to measure velocity of objects we can get a better understanding of the sorrounding environment than we could using one of the sensors alone.

## Classroom Workspace

The workspace provided in the SFND classroom comes preinstallated with everything that you need to finish the exercises and projects. Versions used by Udacity for this ND are as follows:

* Ubuntu 16.04
* PCL - v1.7.2
* C++ v11
* gcc v5.5

**Note** The [[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt)] file provided in this repo can be used locally if you have the same package versions as mentioned above. If you want to run this project locally (outside the Udacity workspace), please follow the steps under the **Local Installation** section.


## Local Installation

### Ubuntu 

1. Clone this github repo:

   ```sh
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection.git
   ```

2.  Edit [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) as follows:

   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8 FATAL_ERROR)
   
   add_definitions(-std=c++14)
   
   set(CXX_FLAGS "-Wall")
   set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS, "${CXX_FLAGS}")
   
   project(playback)
   
   find_package(PCL 1.11 REQUIRED)
   
   include_directories(${PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
   link_directories(${PCL_LIBRARY_DIRS})
   add_definitions(${PCL_DEFINITIONS})
   list(REMOVE_ITEM PCL_LIBRARIES "vtkproj4")
   
   
   add_executable (environment src/environment.cpp src/render/render.cpp src/processPointClouds.cpp)
   target_link_libraries (environment ${PCL_LIBRARIES})
   ```

3. Execute the following commands in a terminal

   ```shell
   sudo apt install libpcl-dev
   cd ~/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ./environment
   ```

   This should install the latest version of PCL. You should be able to do all the classroom exercises and project with this setup.
   
**Note** The library version of PCL being distributed by the apt repository for 18.04 and 20.04 are both older than v1.11. The following links have the information regarding the versions-

[Bionic 18.04](https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/core/bionic/universe/updates/libpcl-dev)
[Focal 20.04](https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/core/focal/universe/base/libpcl-dev)

You can either build PCL from source (for v1.11) or use the older version.

### MAC

#### Install via Homebrew
1. install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

	$> brew tap brewsci/science
	```
4. view pcl install options
	```bash
	$> brew options pcl
	```
5. install PCL 
	```bash
	$> brew install pcl
	```

6. Clone this github repo

   ```shell
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection.git
   ```

7. Edit the CMakeLists.txt file as shown in Step 2 of Ubuntu installation instructions above.

8. Execute the following commands in a terminal

   ```shell
